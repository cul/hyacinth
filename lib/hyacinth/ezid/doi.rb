# DESGIN NOTE: Currently, the only required EZID indentifiers are DOIs. ARKs are not currently used
# Therefore, only the current class is implemented. However, if ARKs or URNs are implemented
# at a later date, the common functionality can be moved to parent class, and this class and
# the sibling class (ARK and/or URN) will inherit from this new parent class
